# Welcome
This is my project for the AdventOfCode event of 2020 and 2021 (more are following).

AdventOfCode is an annual event which started in 2015 to challenge programmers. 
2 tasks are given each day to solve where the second task is related to the first.
For each task you get 1 star, at the end you should have 50 stars.

## Disclaimers
AdventOfCode is supposed to be done in the advent time 1st to 25th of December, 

* 2020: I am late more than a month for this years event.
* 2021: So far I am keeping up, just 2 days behind. 

# What to do here?
Have a look around for many reasons:
* You are stuck and want to know how to solve a problem
* You are interested in my coding skills 
* You want to compare your solution to the solution of someone else
* Whatever other reasons you can think of (let me know so I can put it here)

You can just review all my code and git handling right here on Github or clone the repository 
using your favourite IDE (I prefer JetBrains' Rider) or the ominous *shell*.

I am open to recommendations on how I could have done better.

# Structure
For every event there is a project with the naming convention "Year" 
plus whatever year you are interested in.

For every event there is a xUnit test project with the naming convention "Test" 
plus whatever year it is referencing to.

# Prerequisites 
* .net 6 SDK 

# Lessons learned
* Linq simplifies everything and makes the code much more readable
* Unit testing is a must to see ones mistakes and fix it quickly
* Taking a 10 minute thinking break makes solving problem far easier
