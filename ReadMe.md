# Welcome
This is my project for the AdventOfCode event.

AdventOfCode is an annual event started in 2015 to challenge programmers. 
2 tasks are given each day to solve where the second task is related to the first.

## Disclaimer
AdventOfCode is supposed to be done in the advent time 1st to 25th of December, 
I am late more than a month for 2020 as you may have been able to guess by the dates.

# What to do
Have a look around for many reasons:
* You are stuck and want to know how to solve a problem
* You are interested in my coding skills 
* You want to compare your solution to the solution of someone else
* Whatever other reasons you can think of (let me know so I can put it here)

You can just review all my code and git handling right here on Github or clone the repository 
using your favourite IDE (I prefer JetBrains' Rider).

I am open to recommendations on how I could have done better.

# Structure
For every event there is a project with the naming convention "Year" 
plus whatever year you are interested in.

For every event there is a xUnit test project with the naming convention "Test" 
plus whatever year it is referencing to.

# Prerequisites 
* .net 5 SDK
