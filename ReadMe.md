# Welcome
This is my project for the AdventOfCode event.

AdventOfCode is an annual event started in 2016 to challenge programmers. 2 tasks are given each day to solve.

## Disclaimer
AdventOfCode is supposed to be done in the advent time 1st to 24th of December, I am late more than a month for 2020 as you may have been able to guess by the dates.

# What to do
Have a look around for many reasons:
* You are stuck and want to know how to solve a problem
* You are interested in my coding skills 
* You want to compare your solution to the solution of someone else

You can just review all my code and git handling right here on Github or clone the repository using your favourite IDE (I prefer JetBrains' Rider)

I am open to recommendations on how I could have done better

# Structure
For every event there is a project with the naming convention "Year" plus whatever year you are interested in.

For every event there is a xUnit test project with the naming convention "Test" plus whatever year it is referencing.

# Prerequisites 
* .net 5 SDK
